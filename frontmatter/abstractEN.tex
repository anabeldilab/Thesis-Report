This thesis explores the integration of a brain-computer interface (BCI) for controlling electromechanical devices. The main objective is to investigate and evaluate the beneficial applications of this interface, with a particular focus on individuals with reduced mobility. Successful implementation of the BCI interface was achieved in a pan-tilt system and a robot. Through user testing with a specifically designed graphical interface, effectiveness and user experience were evaluated. The results indicate that brain-computer interfaces are a valuable tool for promoting the inclusion of individuals with mobility limitations, empowering them to achieve greater independence in controlling specific electromechanical devices.
