This thesis explores the integration of a brain-computer interface (BCI) for controlling electromechanical devices. The main objective is to explore and evaluate the beneficial applications of this interface, especially for individuals with reduced mobility. The BCI interface was successfully implemented in a pan-tilt system and a mobile robot. Tests were conducted with participants using a specifically developed graphical interface to evaluate effectiveness and user experience. The obtained results indicate that the BCI used, NextMind, is a truly useful tool for the inclusion of individuals with mobility limitations, enabling them to achieve greater independence in controlling specific electromechanical devices, including telepresence. Furthermore, NextMind has shown excellent performance in outdoor environments, making it particularly useful in the field of electromechanical device control.
